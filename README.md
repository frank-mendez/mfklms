## Testing & Quality Assurance

This project includes a comprehensive testing setup with automated quality checks to ensure code reliability and maintain high standards.

### Testing Framework

- **Jest** - Testing framework with Next.js integration
- **Testing Library** - React component testing utilities
- **Coverage Reports** - Detailed test coverage analysis
- **Pre-commit Hooks** - Automated quality gates

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests in CI mode (no watch)
npm run test:ci

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

### Test Coverage

Current test coverage includes:

- **Components**: React component behavior and user interactions
- **Utils**: Business logic and utility functions
- **React Query Hooks**: API integration and data fetching
- **Calculation Logic**: Loan repayment calculations and validations

Coverage reports are generated in the `coverage/` directory and include:

- HTML reports (`coverage/index.html`)
- LCOV format for CI integration
- Console summary with detailed metrics

### Pre-commit Quality Checks

Every commit automatically runs:

1. **üî® Build Validation**

   - TypeScript compilation
   - Next.js build process
   - ESLint code quality checks
   - Dependency resolution verification

2. **üß™ Test Execution**

   - All Jest unit tests
   - Coverage threshold validation
   - Test failure detection

3. **‚úÖ Commit Protection**
   - Blocks commits if build fails
   - Prevents commits with failing tests
   - Ensures code quality standards

```bash
# The pre-commit hook runs automatically, but you can test manually:
npm run build && npm run test:ci
```

### Test Structure

‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ __tests__/          # Component tests
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ __tests__/          # Utility function tests

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ jest.setup.js           # Test environment setup
```

### Writing Tests

The project uses Jest with Testing Library for comprehensive testing:

```typescript
// Component test example
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from "@testing-library/react";
import MyComponent from "../MyComponent";

test("renders and handles user interaction", () => {
  render(<MyComponent />);
  const button = screen.getByRole("button");
  fireEvent.click(button);
  expect(screen.getByText("Updated")).toBeInTheDocument();
});

// Utility function test example
import { calculateTotal } from "../calculations";

test("calculates total correctly", () => {
  expect(calculateTotal(100, 0.12)).toBe(112);
});
```

### Continuous Integration

The testing setup is designed for CI/CD integration:

- Tests run automatically on every commit
- Coverage reports can be integrated with CI platforms
- Build validation prevents deployment of broken code
- Standardized test commands across environments

### Quality Standards

- **Coverage Threshold**: Minimum coverage requirements enforced
- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests alongside new features
- **Component Testing**: User-focused testing approach
- **Business Logic Testing**: Critical calculations and validations covered

## Default Admin Credentials

- Email: admin@example.com
- Password: admin123

**Important**: Change these credentials before deploying to production!

## Deployment

### Vercel Deployment

This project is configured for automatic deployment to Vercel with database migration and seeding.

1. **Connect your repository to Vercel:**

   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Vercel will automatically detect the Next.js framework

2. **Set up environment variables in Vercel:**

   ```env
   DATABASE_URL="your-production-database-url"
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-production-secret"
   NEXTAUTH_URL="https://your-app.vercel.app"
   ```

3. **Deploy:**
   - Push to your main branch
   - Vercel will automatically:
     - Install dependencies
     - Generate Prisma client
     - Run database migrations
     - Seed the database
     - Build and deploy the application

The `vercel.json` configuration ensures that:

- Database migrations run during build
- Initial data is seeded automatically
- API routes have appropriate timeout settings
- Prisma is properly configured for serverless

### Manual Database Operations on Vercel

If you need to run database operations manually after deployment:

```bash
# Reset and reseed database (be careful in production!)
npm run db:reset

# Just run seeding
npm run db:seed

# Run migrations only
npm run db:deploy
```

### Production Environment Variables

Make sure to set these in your Vercel dashboard:

- `DATABASE_URL` - Your production PostgreSQL connection string
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - A secure random string for JWT signing
- `NEXTAUTH_URL` - Your deployed application URL
